  <h2><br> Background history</h2>
  <hr>
  
  <p>Tiffany & Co., founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and John B. Young in New York City, initially operated as a "stationery and fancy goods emporium" before shifting its focus to jewelry in 1853. The brand revolutionized the jewelry industry with the introduction of the iconic Tiffany Setting ring, featuring six prongs to accentuate the diamond, and by marking prices on goods to eliminate haggling. Their commitment to uncompromising quality, unique design, and impeccable craftsmanship has made Tiffany a symbol of luxury and enduring elegance. Over the years, Tiffany has expanded its product line and presence globally, with a significant impact on popular culture.</p>
